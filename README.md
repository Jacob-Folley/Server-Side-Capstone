# Career Connect
A website that starts by choosing: __Applicant__ / __Employer__. The applicant can upload their resume, search for jobs, and keep track of their job applications. An employer can post jobs, search through applicants, and keep track of all their job postings.

## Motivation
Recently I have been using a lot of different job application sites. I realized that a lot of them had a good amount of unnecessary steps when filling out applications. My goal was to make a site that helped simplify the process so the users can have a more efficient experience. 

## Technologies:
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- Django
